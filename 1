\section{What is GNU?}
GNU is an operating system that is free softwareâ€”that is, it respects users; freedom. The
GNU operating system consists of GNU packages (programs specifically released by the
GNU Project) as well as free software released by third parties. The development of GNU
made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom.
\section{More about GNU}
GNU is a Unix-like operating system. That means it is a collection of many programs:
applications, libraries, developer tools, even games. The development of GNU, started in
January 1984, is known as the GNU Project. Many of the programs in GNU are released
under the auspices of the GNU Project; those we call GNU packages.

 GNU is typically used with a kernel called Linux. This
combination is the GNU/Linux operating system. GNU/Linux is used by millions,  \par
Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, 
i request you to take into consideration all the aspects.

After setting up the GNU Project in 1983, Richard Stallman set up the Free Software
Foundation in 1985 to advance knowledge about free software and to advocate for its
development and use.
Today, all free software, including GNU OS, is based on four freedoms: use, study, share,
improve. This means that any user has the freedom to use free software like GNU without
restrictions and for any purpose; study it without having to sign nondisclosure agreements
(NDA); copy and share GNU with anyone; and modify, improve and share it in any
public forum.
As long as the software;s license contains these four freedoms, the software is considered
free. Any software whose license agreement does not contain even one of the freedoms
cannot be considered free. Any software that does not appear in a list of reviewed and
approved licenses maintained by the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source
Initiative is also not considered free.
Learn how to troubleshoot the Linux kernel using a crash tool and why not all open
source is created equal. See why developers should ask themselves if they have license to
build with that (open) software and how open source license issues can stymie enterprise
contributions projects. Check out 83 useful Linux commands.
\section{What is Free Software?}
Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. More precisely, free software means
users of a program have the four essential freedoms:
\begin{itemize}
\item The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
\item The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your
computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
\item The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
\item The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).
\par
By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.
Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
Developments in technology and network use have made these freedoms even more
important now than they were in 1983. Nowadays the free software movement goes far
beyond developing the GNU system.
